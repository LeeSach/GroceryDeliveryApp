Design a grocery/restaurant delivery app:

Restaurant Delivery App Development

1.	Restaurant App using Python (Django) and Bootstrap
Profile Creation
Allow restaurant owners to register and create profile following a few simple steps. To create a profile, owners can include information like restaurant address, complete menu with price, delivery, and contact details.
Order Management
Allow owners to manage all the orders at one place, including ongoing, dispatched, pickups and scheduled ones. With just single touch on the screen, owners can get a complete view of the orders.
Menu Management
Restaurant owners can manage a complete menu of the restaurant by adding and updating the list, prices, items, today’s special dish, and minimum order amount.
Manage Promos & Deals
Restaurant businesses can create and add new discount deals and offers, rewarding their customers to get benefits on ordering food.
Real-time Tracking of Driver
Restaurant owners can track the delivery driver with his real-time location. Owners can also check the total delivery time and route that driver preferred to deliver the food.
Push Notifications
Alert or notification will notify restaurant owners about the new order, status of received or shipped orders, payment received online, and other important updates about the delivery driver and customers.

2.	Customer’s App using Ionic
Search
Allow your app users to search different restaurants, cafes, pubs, and bars by location and cuisines. Using the search feature, your users can explore different restaurants, dishes, and favourite cuisines.
Order
With an easy-to-order feature, users can place an order of selected dishes and food with just a few simple taps on the screen. They just need to add their preferred dish and proceed to check-out.
Real-time Tracking of Driver
With real-time tracking feature, it becomes easy for your users to track delivery drivers and know their real-time location information. Users can check how much time a driver will take to reach.
Payment Gateway Integration
Integrate your app like Grubhub and Uber Eats with Payment Gateway like Braintree or Stripe and allow users to pay by credit/debit card. Make sure that you provide your users with multiple payment options.
Ratings & Reviews
Allow users to give ratings and share reviews for the restaurant, food, and delivery driver’s service. Ratings and reviews play an important role in improving overall service.
Real-time Availability
Allow your app users to get information on the real-time availability of the tables in different restaurants and make the bookings with just a few simple clicks.

3.	Delivery Driver App using Ionic
Registration & Login
Drivers can register and login in the application through social media networks like Gmail, Facebook, and Google+. By entering simple details, drivers can register and login in the app.
User Profile
Delivery drivers can maintain complete profile information, including name, email address, contact number, photo and other important information. Drivers can keep their profile updated.
Update & Alert for New Order
Drivers will get push notification for the new order that is assigned. Even when the app is closed, drivers will get a sound notification for the order assigned.
Manage Multiple Food Deliveries
Drivers can also manage multiple food delivers at a single time and respond to all the requests that are nearby to other delivery locations.
Map to View Delivery Route
Integrate Google Map or Waze and allow drivers to choose the shortest and fastest routes to reach the location. With on-time delivery, you can delight your customers.
Route Optimization
With the best route optimization, drivers get help in delivering the food in minimum driving time by finding the most efficient route for the destination.

4.	Admin Panel using Python (Django) and Bootstrap
Managing Restaurants
Being an admin, you can manage all the restaurants by adding, updating, and removing any restaurant or café from the list. Check any restaurant’s active status on the app.
Category Management
Manage categories of all the restaurants based on the cuisine type, pricing details, delivery options, and offers to optimize business. At one single platform, you can manage several restaurants with types.
Performance Monitoring
Monitor all the drivers, deliveries, ratings & reviews of drivers, cancelled orders, and other important data related to driver’s performance.
Analysing & Reporting
Using analysis and report feature, you can get real-time insights of reports and other accounting information that help you to identify the growth and opportunities to expand reach.
Real-time Updates & Alerts
Get real-time updates and notifications about the drivers and restaurant owners when they update their profile, restaurant information, and made changes in the availability.
Payment & Commission Management
Allow owners to set payment and commission rate and manage it directly from the panel with every single partner and make payments.
Backend
Python
In Python programming language both Django and Flask are the flexible choice to develop the food delivery software according to your business requirements. Since Django has the default admin panel, the developers have no need to install any third-party libraries to build an admin panel. 
Database
MySQL
If you seek both productive and functional, then MySQL will be the right database choice.
